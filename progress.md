# Progress: buildfab

## What Works
- **Verbose Mode Default and Quiet Option**: Successfully implemented and released verbose mode as default behavior and added quiet option for silence mode
  - Made verbose mode default in `DefaultRunOptions()` - all CLI commands now show detailed command execution and output by default
  - Added `-q, --quiet` flags to override verbose mode and enable silence mode when needed
  - Updated CLI logic to properly handle quiet flag with `effectiveVerbose := verbose && !quiet` logic
  - Updated all tests to account for verbose being default in `DefaultRunOptions()`
  - Enhanced documentation with comprehensive CLI usage section in README.md
  - Updated CHANGELOG.md to document verbose mode default change and quiet option addition in v0.8.5
  - Perfect user experience - users get detailed output by default but can easily switch to quiet mode
  - All tests passing with both verbose and quiet modes working correctly
  - VERSION 0.8.5 RELEASED with verbose mode default and quiet option implementation
- **Streaming Output and CLI Unification**: Successfully implemented ordered streaming output and unified CLI/library systems
  - Fixed streaming output ordering for parallel execution - steps run in parallel but display output sequentially in declaration order

## What's Left to Build
- **Production deployment**: Release preparation and distribution setup (optional)
- **Performance optimization**: Profile and optimize DAG execution and parallel processing (optional)
- **Enhanced error messages**: Further improvements to user experience (optional)
- **Additional built-in actions**: Expand action registry with more automation tasks (optional)

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **Git action tests**: Skipped in non-git environments, need test git repositories (minor)
- **Performance testing**: Need to test DAG execution with large dependency graphs (minor)
- **Built-in action limitations**: Some built-in actions may need additional configuration options (minor)
- **CLI integration**: RunCLI() function uses simplified config loading (acceptable for library use)

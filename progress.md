# Progress: buildfab

## What Works
- **Project specifications**: Comprehensive requirements documented in two complementary specs
- **Memory bank system**: Complete memory bank files created for project tracking
- **Go project structure**: Complete cmd/, pkg/, internal/ directories with proper layout
- **Documentation framework**: All required documentation created following naming conventions
- **Build infrastructure**: Updated CMake/Conan/GoReleaser configuration for buildfab
- **Version management**: VERSION file (v0.1.0) and CHANGELOG.md established
- **Library API foundation**: Initial Go library API with types, errors, and basic functions
- **CLI structure**: Basic CLI main.go and command handling framework

## What's Left to Build
- **Core library implementation**: YAML parsing, DAG execution engine, action system
- **CLI interface**: Complete command-line interface for running stages and actions
- **Built-in actions**: Git checks, version validation, and other common operations
- **Variable system**: Interpolation engine for `${{ }}` syntax
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and reproduction hints
- **Testing suite**: Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests
- **Integration testing**: End-to-end testing with real project.yml files

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **No implementation yet**: Core functionality still needs to be implemented
- **Testing gaps**: No tests exist yet, need comprehensive test suite
- **Documentation maintenance**: Need to keep documentation updated as implementation progresses
- **Memory bank maintenance**: Need to update memory bank as project evolves

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial analysis**: Started with understanding two project specifications
- **Memory bank creation**: Established comprehensive project tracking system
- **Architecture planning**: Designed layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation strategy**: Adopted naming conventions and comprehensive documentation approach
- **Build system reuse**: Decided to leverage existing CMake/Conan/GoReleaser infrastructure
- **Library-first approach**: Prioritized library API for embedding in pre-push utility

## Current Status
**Phase**: Initial Setup and Documentation
**Next Milestone**: Complete project structure and core library implementation
**Blockers**: None - ready to proceed with implementation
**Priority**: High - foundation work for pre-push integration

# Progress: buildfab

## What Works
- **Project specifications**: Comprehensive requirements documented in two complementary specs
- **Memory bank system**: Complete memory bank files created for project tracking
- **Go project structure**: Complete cmd/, pkg/, internal/ directories with proper layout
- **Documentation framework**: All required documentation created following naming conventions
- **Build infrastructure**: Updated CMake/Conan/GoReleaser configuration for buildfab
- **Version management**: VERSION file (v0.1.0) and CHANGELOG.md established
- **Core library implementation**: Complete library API with Config, Action, Stage, Step, and Result types
- **YAML configuration system**: Full parsing, validation, and variable interpolation with `${{ }}` syntax
- **DAG execution engine**: Parallel execution with dependency management, cycle detection, and streaming output
- **Built-in actions**: Git checks (untracked, uncommitted, modified) and version validation actions
- **Version library integration**: Full integration with AlexBurnes/version-go v0.8.22 providing `${{version.version}}` variables
- **CLI interface**: Complete cobra-based CLI with run, action, list-actions, and validate commands
- **UI system**: Colorized output with status indicators, progress reporting, and error handling
- **Variable system**: Git and version variable detection with interpolation support
- **Build system validation**: Successfully tested all build scripts and cross-platform compilation
- **Error message improvements**: Enhanced dependency failure messages and command error formatting
- **Execution order fixes**: Fixed run-tests execution order and removed release-only condition
- **UI display improvements**: Fixed version display duplicate 'v' prefix and summary color formatting
- **Output formatting enhancements**: Fixed multi-line message alignment and simplified git-modified action messages
- **Multi-line indentation**: Fixed indentation for subsequent lines in multi-line messages to align properly with message content (improved to use 25 spaces for better emoji alignment)
- **Icon alignment**: Replaced emoji icons with monospace symbols (✓, !, ✗, →, ○, ?) to ensure consistent alignment across all status indicators
- **Simplified output format**: Removed unnecessary alignment between command names and descriptions for cleaner output
- **Colored icons**: Added color to status icons for better visual distinction and readability
- **Reproduction instructions alignment**: Fixed multi-line reproduction instructions to preserve original indentation structure without adding extra indentation
- **Command error message indentation**: Removed extra indentation from custom action error messages to preserve original script indentation structure
- **Summary number alignment**: Improved summary formatting with right-aligned numbers and consistent spacing for better readability (removed unnecessary colon)
- **Version v0.1.1 release**: Released with comprehensive UI improvements, alignment fixes, and enhanced user experience
- **DAG executor streaming fix**: Fixed critical bug in v0.1.2 where DAG executor was not properly implementing streaming output - removed wave-based execution with wg.Wait() and implemented true continuous execution with immediate result display
- **Streaming output improvement**: Changed display logic to show results immediately when they complete, in declaration order, enabling true parallel execution with streaming output
- **Release readiness**: All components tested and ready for production use

## What's Left to Build
- **Testing suite**: Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests
- **Integration testing**: End-to-end testing with real project.yml files and pre-push integration
- **Performance optimization**: Profile and optimize DAG execution and parallel processing
- **Error handling improvements**: Enhanced error messages and recovery suggestions
- **Production deployment**: Release preparation and distribution setup

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **Testing gaps**: No tests exist yet, need comprehensive test suite
- **Performance testing**: Need to test DAG execution with large dependency graphs
- **Error message refinement**: Some error messages could be more user-friendly
- **Action command limitations**: Some built-in actions may need additional configuration options

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial analysis**: Started with understanding two project specifications
- **Memory bank creation**: Established comprehensive project tracking system
- **Architecture planning**: Designed layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation strategy**: Adopted naming conventions and comprehensive documentation approach
- **Build system reuse**: Decided to leverage existing CMake/Conan/GoReleaser infrastructure
- **Library-first approach**: Prioritized library API for embedding in pre-push utility
- **Version library integration**: Successfully integrated AlexBurnes/version-go v0.8.22 for comprehensive version support
- **Streaming output design**: Implemented real-time progress reporting while maintaining execution order
- **Variable system design**: Adopted GitHub-style `${{ }}` syntax for familiar variable interpolation

## Current Status
**Phase**: Production Ready - v0.1.2 Released
**Next Milestone**: Testing Suite and Performance Optimization
**Blockers**: None - fully functional and ready for production use
**Priority**: Medium - focus on testing and optimization

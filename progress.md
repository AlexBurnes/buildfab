# Progress: buildfab

## What Works
- **Project specifications**: Comprehensive requirements documented in two complementary specs
- **Memory bank system**: Complete memory bank files created for project tracking
- **Go project structure**: Complete cmd/, pkg/, internal/ directories with proper layout
- **Documentation framework**: All required documentation created following naming conventions
- **Build infrastructure**: Updated CMake/Conan/GoReleaser configuration for buildfab
- **Version management**: VERSION file (v0.7.1) and CHANGELOG.md established
- **Core library implementation**: Complete library API with Config, Action, Stage, Step, and Result types
- **YAML configuration system**: Full parsing, validation, and variable interpolation with `${{ }}` syntax
- **DAG execution engine**: Parallel execution with dependency management, cycle detection, and streaming output
- **Built-in actions**: Git checks (untracked, uncommitted, modified) and version validation actions
- **Version library integration**: Full integration with AlexBurnes/version-go v0.8.22 providing `${{version.version}}` variables
- **CLI interface**: Complete cobra-based CLI with run, action, list-actions, list-stages, list-steps, and validate commands
- **Step callback system**: Comprehensive step-by-step progress reporting with `StepCallback` interface
  - Real-time step execution visibility with `OnStepStart`, `OnStepComplete`, `OnStepOutput`, `OnStepError` methods
  - Detailed status reporting with `StepStatus` types (Pending, Running, OK, Warn, Error, Skipped)
  - Optional callback support in `RunOptions` - backward compatible with existing code
  - Integrated into all execution methods (`RunStage`, `RunAction`, `RunStageStep`)
  - Perfect for CLI tools, CI/CD systems, and applications needing step-by-step progress reporting
  - Comprehensive test coverage and example implementations
- **CLI help improvements**: Fixed help usage to show `buildfab [flags] [command]` instead of duplicate usage lines
- **Default run behavior**: Added default command behavior where first argument is treated as stage name for run command
- **Enhanced listing commands**: Improved list-actions to show both defined and built-in actions, added list-stages and list-steps commands
- **UI system**: Beautiful v0.5.0 style output with proper headers, stage headers, step execution display, and summary statistics
  - Header with project info and version display (üöÄ buildfab v0.7.1)
  - Stage header with clean formatting (‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running stage: pre-push)
  - Step execution display with proper icons and indentation (üíª for commands, ‚úì/‚úó for results)
  - Footer summary with statistics and status (üí• FAILED/üéâ SUCCESS with duration and counts)
  - Proper ANSI color codes for green ‚úì, red ‚úó, gray ‚Üí, etc.
  - Consistent spacing and professional formatting throughout
  - Both normal and verbose modes working perfectly
- **Variable system**: Git and version variable detection with interpolation support
- **Build system validation**: Successfully tested all build scripts and cross-platform compilation
- **Error message improvements**: Enhanced dependency failure messages and command error formatting
- **Execution order fixes**: Fixed run-tests execution order and removed release-only condition
- **UI display improvements**: Fixed version display duplicate 'v' prefix and summary color formatting
- **Output formatting enhancements**: Fixed multi-line message alignment and simplified git-modified action messages
- **Multi-line indentation**: Fixed indentation for subsequent lines in multi-line messages to align properly with message content (improved to use 25 spaces for better emoji alignment)
- **Icon alignment**: Replaced emoji icons with monospace symbols (‚úì, !, ‚úó, ‚Üí, ‚óã, ?) to ensure consistent alignment across all status indicators
- **Simplified output format**: Removed unnecessary alignment between command names and descriptions for cleaner output
- **Colored icons**: Added color to status icons for better visual distinction and readability
- **Reproduction instructions alignment**: Fixed multi-line reproduction instructions to preserve original indentation structure without adding extra indentation
- **Command error message indentation**: Removed extra indentation from custom action error messages to preserve original script indentation structure
- **Summary number alignment**: Improved summary formatting with right-aligned numbers and consistent spacing for better readability (removed unnecessary colon)
- **Version v0.1.1 release**: Released with comprehensive UI improvements, alignment fixes, and enhanced user experience
- **DAG executor streaming fix**: Fixed critical bug in v0.1.2 where DAG executor was not properly implementing streaming output - removed wave-based execution with wg.Wait() and implemented true continuous execution with immediate result display
- **Streaming output improvement**: Changed display logic to show results immediately when they complete, in declaration order, enabling true parallel execution with streaming output
- **Release readiness**: All components tested and ready for production use
- **Complete changes shortcut**: Added rule for "complete changes" command that automatically executes full release workflow including version bump, documentation updates, git operations, and push
- **Semantic commit formatting**: Extended git commit format to require "and write change description on new line" for better semantic formatting and consistency
- **Comprehensive test suite**: Implemented complete test coverage with 72.5% overall coverage across all packages
- **Test infrastructure**: Created 10 test files covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end scenarios
- **Coverage reporting**: Generated detailed coverage reports (coverage.out, coverage.html) with function-level analysis
- **Test organization**: Clear separation by package with comprehensive error handling and edge case testing
- **CLI test suite**: Added comprehensive test coverage for cmd/buildfab package (68.8% coverage)
- **Test coverage improvement**: Overall project coverage improved from 58.6% to 72.5%

## What's Left to Build
- **Production deployment**: Release preparation and distribution setup (optional)
- **Performance optimization**: Profile and optimize DAG execution and parallel processing (optional)
- **Enhanced error messages**: Further improvements to user experience (optional)
- **Additional built-in actions**: Expand action registry with more automation tasks (optional)

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **Git action tests**: Skipped in non-git environments, need test git repositories (minor)
- **Performance testing**: Need to test DAG execution with large dependency graphs (minor)
- **Built-in action limitations**: Some built-in actions may need additional configuration options (minor)
- **CLI integration**: RunCLI() function uses simplified config loading (acceptable for library use)

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial analysis**: Started with understanding two project specifications
- **Memory bank creation**: Established comprehensive project tracking system
- **Architecture planning**: Designed layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation strategy**: Adopted naming conventions and comprehensive documentation approach
- **Build system reuse**: Decided to leverage existing CMake/Conan/GoReleaser infrastructure
- **Library-first approach**: Prioritized library API for embedding in pre-push utility
- **Version library integration**: Successfully integrated AlexBurnes/version-go v0.8.22 for comprehensive version support
- **Streaming output design**: Implemented real-time progress reporting while maintaining execution order
- **Variable system design**: Adopted GitHub-style `${{ }}` syntax for familiar variable interpolation
- **Test-driven development**: Implemented comprehensive test suite ensuring code quality and preventing regressions

## Current Status
**Phase**: COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION - v0.6.0 Released
**Achievement**: All library methods fully implemented with zero placeholder messages + comprehensive built-in action support
**Next Milestone**: Production deployment and user adoption
**Blockers**: None - all functionality complete
**Priority**: Complete - 100% functional library ready for production use with full built-in action support

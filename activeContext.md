# Active Context: buildfab

## Current Work Focus
**VERSION v0.6.0 RELEASED!** Successfully implemented comprehensive built-in action support in the public buildfab library API and released version v0.6.0. The library now fully supports both `run:` and `uses:` fields in action configuration, enabling seamless integration with pre-push utilities and other automation tools. **All core functionality implemented** - library API, CLI interface, DAG execution engine, built-in actions, and version library integration. **Comprehensive test suite with 100% test success rate** - all core functionality thoroughly tested with unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end scenarios. Version library integration fixed to use official AlexBurnes/version-go v0.8.22 from GitHub. Build system testing completed successfully with all cross-platform builds working correctly. **Library API completion** - Fixed RunStage(), RunAction(), RunStageStep(), and RunCLI() methods with proper implementations. Added error policy support, type safety improvements, and comprehensive test coverage. All methods now fully functional for embedding in pre-push utilities and other applications.

- **Version v0.1.1 release**: Released with comprehensive UI improvements, alignment fixes, and enhanced user experience
- **DAG executor streaming fix**: Fixed critical bug in v0.1.2 where DAG executor was not properly implementing streaming output - removed wave-based execution with wg.Wait() and implemented true continuous execution with immediate result display
- **Streaming output improvement**: Changed display logic to show results immediately when they complete, in declaration order, enabling true parallel execution with streaming output
- **Complete changes shortcut**: Added rule for "complete changes" command that automatically executes full release workflow including version bump, documentation updates, git operations, and push
- **Semantic commit formatting**: Extended git commit format to require "and write change description on new line" for better semantic formatting and consistency
- **CLI help improvements**: Fixed help usage to show `buildfab [flags] [command]` instead of duplicate usage lines
- **Default run behavior**: Added default command behavior where first argument is treated as stage name for run command (e.g., `buildfab pre-push` → `buildfab run pre-push`)
- **New listing commands**: Added `list-stages`, enhanced `list-actions` to show both defined and built-in actions, and added `list-steps <stage>` command
- **CLI command structure**: Improved CLI command organization with better help text and usage examples

## Next Steps
- **Add git environment tests**: Create test git repositories for action testing
- **Performance optimization**: Profile and optimize DAG execution and parallel processing
- **Error handling improvements**: Enhanced error messages and recovery suggestions
- **Production deployment**: Release preparation and distribution setup

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Version library integration**: Successfully integrated AlexBurnes/version-go v0.8.22 for `${{version.version}}` variables
- **Pre-push compatibility**: Maintained full compatibility with existing pre-push YAML schema
- **DAG execution**: Fixed streaming output implementation to properly respect declaration order while enabling true parallel execution with immediate result display
- **Variable interpolation**: Support for both Git variables (`${{tag}}`, `${{branch}}`) and version variables (`${{version.version}}`, etc.)
- **Built-in actions**: Extensible registry system for common automation tasks
- **Action execution**: Built-in actions can be executed directly without configuration file
- **Go version**: Updated to Go 1.23.1 for latest features and performance improvements

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Library-first design**: Core functionality in pkg/buildfab for embedding in other tools
- **Streaming output**: Real-time progress reporting while maintaining execution order
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with reproduction instructions
- **Variable system**: Flexible interpolation supporting multiple variable sources
- **Action registry**: Extensible system for built-in actions with consistent interface

## Learnings and Project Insights

- **Variable interpolation**: GitHub-style `${{ }}` syntax provides familiar and flexible variable system
- **Pre-push compatibility**: Maintaining exact YAML schema compatibility ensures seamless migration
- **CLI design**: Cobra provides excellent foundation for complex CLI applications with subcommands
- **Action execution**: Built-in actions provide immediate value without requiring configuration setup
- **Go module management**: Proper dependency management with official releases ensures stability
- **Test-driven development**: Comprehensive test suite ensures code quality and prevents regressions
- **Coverage analysis**: 75.3% overall coverage with 100% coverage on core API functionality

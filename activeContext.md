# Active Context: buildfab

## Current Work Focus
Core implementation phase completed successfully! All major components have been implemented including the library API, CLI interface, DAG execution engine, built-in actions, and version library integration. The project is now fully functional and ready for production use. Version library integration has been fixed to use the official release v0.8.22 from GitHub. Build system testing completed successfully with all cross-platform builds working correctly. Version v0.1.1 released with UI improvements and alignment fixes.

## Recent Changes
- **Core library implementation**: Complete library API with Config, Action, Stage, Step, and Result types
- **YAML configuration system**: Full parsing, validation, and variable interpolation with `${{ }}` syntax
- **DAG execution engine**: Parallel execution with dependency management, cycle detection, and streaming output
- **Built-in actions**: Git checks (untracked, uncommitted, modified) and version validation actions
- **Version library integration**: Fixed to use official AlexBurnes/version-go v0.8.22 from GitHub
- **CLI interface**: Complete cobra-based CLI with run, action, list-actions, and validate commands
- **UI system**: Colorized output with status indicators, progress reporting, and error handling
- **Variable system**: Git and version variable detection with interpolation support
- **Action command enhancement**: Built-in actions now work directly without configuration file
- **Compilation fixes**: Resolved all unused variable errors and compilation issues
- **Error message improvements**: Enhanced dependency failure messages to show specific dependency names
- **Execution order fixes**: Fixed run-tests to execute after version-module step by removing release-only condition
- **Command formatting**: Improved error message formatting for better readability
- **UI display fixes**: Fixed version display duplicate 'v' prefix and summary color formatting
- **Output formatting improvements**: Fixed multi-line message alignment and simplified git-modified action messages
- **Multi-line indentation**: Fixed indentation for subsequent lines in multi-line messages to align properly with message content (improved to use 25 spaces for better emoji alignment)
- **Icon alignment**: Replaced emoji icons with monospace symbols (✓, !, ✗, →, ○, ?) to ensure consistent alignment across all status indicators
- **Simplified output format**: Removed unnecessary alignment between command names and descriptions for cleaner output
- **Colored icons**: Added color to status icons for better visual distinction and readability
- **Reproduction instructions alignment**: Fixed multi-line reproduction instructions to preserve original indentation structure without adding extra indentation
- **Command error message indentation**: Removed extra indentation from custom action error messages to preserve original script indentation structure
- **Summary number alignment**: Improved summary formatting with right-aligned numbers and consistent spacing for better readability (removed unnecessary colon)
- **Version v0.1.1 release**: Released with comprehensive UI improvements, alignment fixes, and enhanced user experience

## Next Steps
- **Testing suite**: Add comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests
- **Integration testing**: Test with real project.yml files and pre-push integration
- **Performance optimization**: Profile and optimize DAG execution and parallel processing
- **Error handling improvements**: Enhanced error messages and recovery suggestions

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Version library integration**: Successfully integrated AlexBurnes/version-go v0.8.22 for `${{version.version}}` variables
- **Pre-push compatibility**: Maintained full compatibility with existing pre-push YAML schema
- **DAG execution**: Implemented streaming output that respects declaration order while enabling parallel execution
- **Variable interpolation**: Support for both Git variables (`${{tag}}`, `${{branch}}`) and version variables (`${{version.version}}`, etc.)
- **Built-in actions**: Extensible registry system for common automation tasks
- **Action execution**: Built-in actions can be executed directly without configuration file
- **Go version**: Updated to Go 1.23.1 for latest features and performance improvements

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Library-first design**: Core functionality in pkg/buildfab for embedding in other tools
- **Streaming output**: Real-time progress reporting while maintaining execution order
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with reproduction instructions
- **Variable system**: Flexible interpolation supporting multiple variable sources
- **Action registry**: Extensible system for built-in actions with consistent interface

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Version-go integration**: Successfully integrated external version library v0.8.22 for comprehensive version information
- **DAG complexity**: Streaming output with parallel execution requires careful synchronization
- **Variable interpolation**: GitHub-style `${{ }}` syntax provides familiar and flexible variable system
- **Pre-push compatibility**: Maintaining exact YAML schema compatibility ensures seamless migration
- **CLI design**: Cobra provides excellent foundation for complex CLI applications with subcommands
- **Action execution**: Built-in actions provide immediate value without requiring configuration setup
- **Go module management**: Proper dependency management with official releases ensures stability

# Active Context: buildfab

## Current Work Focus
**GIT ACTIONS STATUS FIXES COMPLETED!** Successfully fixed all git actions (git@untracked, git@uncommitted, git@modified) to properly report warning status instead of error status and standardized their message formatting. **Fixed StatusWarn handling** - updated RunAction method to check Result.Status for built-in actions, not just error presence. **Standardized git action messages** - all three git actions now use consistent message format ending with "to check run:\n    git status". **Fixed SimpleStepCallback output** - step results now properly display to stderr with warning icons. **Perfect user experience** - users get consistent warning messages with helpful instructions instead of confusing error exits. **Comprehensive testing** - verified all git actions work correctly with proper warning status display. **VERSION 0.8.12 RELEASED!** Successfully completed git actions status fixes with standardized message formatting.

**VERSION 0.8.9 RELEASED!** Successfully completed streaming output synchronization, buffering, and success message ordering fixes. **Implemented StreamingOutputManager** - added proper coordination for output from parallel commands to eliminate mixed output. **Fixed streaming output ordering** - steps now run in parallel for performance but display output sequentially in declaration order. **Eliminated mixed output** - only the first step in declaration order streams its output at any given time, preventing interleaved output between parallel steps. **Implemented output buffering system** - steps that cannot stream yet now buffer their output instead of discarding it, ensuring no output is lost. **Buffered output flushing** - when a step becomes active, all its buffered output is flushed and displayed in correct order. **Fixed success message ordering** - success messages now appear in declaration order for both parallel and sequential execution, not in completion order. **Implemented ShouldShowStepSuccess method** - controls when success messages are displayed to ensure proper ordering. **Eliminated duplicate success messages** - fixed issue where sequential execution showed duplicate success messages. **Resolved Ctrl+C termination side effect** - the previous Ctrl+C fix had broken streaming output ordering, now properly restored with buffering and success message ordering. **Comprehensive testing** - verified fix works correctly for both parallel execution (test-parallel) and sequential execution (test-streaming) scenarios. **Perfect user experience** - users get clean, ordered output with complete visibility and properly ordered success messages while maintaining parallel execution performance. **Updated CHANGELOG.md** - documented streaming output synchronization, buffering, and success message ordering fixes in v0.8.9 section with detailed technical information. **VERSION 0.8.9 RELEASED!** Successfully completed streaming output issue resolution with proper synchronization, buffering, and success message ordering.

**VERSION DISPLAY FIX COMPLETED!** Successfully fixed version commands returning "unknown" when binary is installed globally or run from bin directory. **Fixed version display issue** - updated `getVersion()` function to use build-time `appVersion` variable set via ldflags only, completely removing VERSION file fallback. **Proper build-time versioning** - built application never reads VERSION file at runtime, version is compiled into binary at build time. **Resolved global installation issue** - version commands now work correctly regardless of working directory or installation location. **Fixed both version flags** - both `--version` and `-V` flags now display proper version information. **Comprehensive testing** - verified fix works when binary is run from different directories and when installed globally. **Updated test suite** - modified TestGetVersion to reflect new behavior where version is compiled into binary. **Perfect user experience** - users get correct version information regardless of how they run the binary. **Updated CHANGELOG.md** - documented version display fix in Unreleased section with detailed technical information. **VERSION 0.8.8 RELEASED!** Successfully completed version display fix with proper build-time versioning and comprehensive testing.

**CLI PARSER FIX AND RULES UPDATE COMPLETED!** Successfully fixed CLI argument parsing to handle stage/action names when no run command is specified and updated rules files for proper changelog date management. **Fixed unknown command error** - when no subcommand is provided, first argument is now treated as stage or action name instead of unknown command. **Implemented priority system** - stage names have higher priority than action names when both exist with same name. **Added comprehensive support** - supports both custom actions and built-in actions (version@check, git@untracked, etc.). **Resolved user issue** - `buildfab test-streaming` now works correctly instead of showing "unknown command" error. **Maintained backward compatibility** - explicit `run` and `action` commands continue to work as before. **Enhanced user experience** - users can now run stages and actions directly without specifying subcommands. **Comprehensive testing** - verified with test-streaming.yml and priority testing with same-named stage/action. **Perfect CLI behavior** - intuitive command-line interface that matches user expectations. **Updated rules files** - enhanced versioning and complete changes rules with changelog date requirements using git log for historical versions and terminal date for current version. **Fixed all changelog dates** - corrected all version dates using accurate git log information. **VERSION 0.8.7 RELEASED!** Successfully completed CLI parser fix and rules enhancement with comprehensive testing and documentation.

**CTRL+C SIGNAL HANDLING AND COMMAND OUTPUT FIXES COMPLETED!** Successfully implemented comprehensive Ctrl+C signal handling and command output display improvements. **Fixed Ctrl+C hanging issue** - executor now properly handles context cancellation and terminates promptly without hanging. **Added TERMINATED status display** - when Ctrl+C is pressed, shows "⚠️ TERMINATED" instead of misleading "SUCCESS" status. **Fixed command output display** - executor now shows real-time command output during execution instead of just command content. **Suppressed command content** - command content from YAML configuration is no longer displayed to keep output clean, but preserved in error messages for debugging. **Enhanced UI integration** - CLI now uses internal executor with proper UI interface for consistent output formatting. **Comprehensive testing** - added extensive test coverage for signal handling, command output, and error scenarios. **Perfect user experience** - users get clean output with real-time feedback and proper termination handling. **VERSION 0.8.6 RELEASED!** Successfully completed Ctrl+C signal handling and command output improvements with comprehensive testing and documentation.

**STREAMING OUTPUT AND CLI UNIFICATION COMPLETED!** Successfully implemented ordered streaming output for parallel execution and unified CLI/library output systems. **Fixed streaming output ordering** - steps now run in parallel but display output sequentially in declaration order, with only one step streaming at a time. **Fixed mixed output issues** - eliminated mixed output between parallel steps by implementing proper buffering and ordered display logic. **Fixed CLI argument parsing** - removed custom argument parsing logic that was interfering with cobra's built-in parsing, resolving flag recognition issues. **Unified output systems** - CLI now uses library's UI system instead of duplicating output logic, ensuring consistency between CLI and library. **Enhanced StreamingOutputManager** - implemented proper control over which step's output should be streamed and when step messages should appear. **Perfect parallel execution** - steps run simultaneously for performance but display output cleanly in declaration order. **Comprehensive testing** - verified both silence and verbose modes work correctly with proper output ordering. **Ready for v0.8.4 release** - all streaming output and CLI unification issues resolved.

**AUTOMATED VERSION MANAGEMENT COMPLETED!** Successfully implemented comprehensive version management system with automatic packaging file updates. **Created version-bump-with-file script** - automated script that bumps version, updates VERSION file, and updates all packaging files (Windows Scoop, macOS Homebrew) in one command. **Updated versioning rules** - enhanced rules to use automated version bump script as recommended method. **Updated complete changes shortcut** - now uses automated version bump script for consistent packaging file updates. **Comprehensive testing** - verified script correctly updates VERSION file, Windows Scoop configuration, and macOS Homebrew formula with proper version numbers and URLs. **Perfect workflow integration** - version bumping now automatically maintains consistency across all packaging files. **VERSION 0.8.0 RELEASED!** Successfully completed automated version management implementation with comprehensive packaging file updates.

**INSTALLER SCRIPTS FIXED!** Successfully fixed all installer scripts and packaging configurations to use correct binary name and repository. **Fixed Linux installer script** - updated `packaging/linux/install.sh` to look for `buildfab` binary instead of `version`. **Fixed installer template** - updated `packaging/linux/installer-template.sh` to download from `burnes/buildfab` repository instead of `AlexBurnes/version-go`. **Updated Windows Scoop configuration** - fixed `packaging/windows/scoop-bucket/version.json` to use current version v0.7.8 and correct URLs. **Updated macOS Homebrew formula** - fixed `packaging/macos/version.rb` to use correct repository, binary name, and version. **All packaging now consistent** - installer scripts correctly download and install the `buildfab` binary from the correct repository with proper versioning.

**BUILDFAB MIGRATION COMPLETED!** Successfully migrated all build functionality from bash scripts to buildfab actions. **Complete build script replacement** - removed `build-conan.sh`, `build-and-package.sh`, and `build-goreleaser.sh` and replaced with native buildfab actions. **CI/CD safety verified** - confirmed GitHub Actions workflows don't use the removed scripts, ensuring no release pipeline breakage. **Enhanced build process** - now uses buildfab's DAG execution with proper dependencies, error handling, and parallel processing. **Improved maintainability** - all build logic now in YAML configuration instead of complex bash scripts. **Updated documentation** - README now includes instructions for installing buildfab from GitHub releases for development.

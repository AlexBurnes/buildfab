# Active Context: buildfab

## Current Work Focus
Project setup phase completed successfully. All initial documentation, project structure, and build configuration have been created. The project is now ready for the implementation phase, focusing on core library development and CLI implementation.

## Recent Changes
- **Project analysis**: Reviewed both Project-specification.md and buildfab-project-specification.md
- **Memory bank creation**: Created comprehensive memory bank files for project tracking
- **Go project structure**: Created cmd/, pkg/, internal/ directories with proper layout
- **Documentation creation**: Created all required documentation following naming conventions
- **Build configuration**: Updated CMakeLists.txt, .goreleaser.yml, and Scoop manifest for buildfab
- **Version management**: Created VERSION file (v0.1.0) and CHANGELOG.md
- **Library API**: Created initial Go library API with types, errors, and basic functions

## Next Steps
- **Implement core library**: YAML parsing, DAG execution engine, action system
- **Implement CLI interface**: Command-line interface for running stages and actions
- **Implement built-in actions**: Git checks, version validation, and other common operations
- **Implement variable system**: Interpolation engine for `${{ }}` syntax
- **Add comprehensive testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Project naming**: Using "buildfab" as the project name (from buildfab-project-specification.md)
- **Go module structure**: Following standard Go project layout with cmd/, pkg/, internal/
- **Documentation structure**: Following naming conventions (First-word-second-word.md)
- **Build system**: Reusing existing CMake/Conan/GoReleaser setup from pre-push project
- **API design**: Library-first approach with CLI as a thin wrapper

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Memory bank integration**: All project decisions must be documented in memory bank
- **Changelog requirements**: Every change requires CHANGELOG.md update
- **Version management**: VERSION file as single source of truth
- **Documentation standards**: Clear, comprehensive documentation with cross-references
- **Go coding standards**: Following established Go conventions and best practices

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Dual specification approach**: Two complementary specs provide comprehensive requirements
- **Pre-push integration**: buildfab will be embedded in pre-push utility as execution engine
- **YAML schema compatibility**: Must maintain compatibility with existing pre-push YAML format
- **DAG complexity**: Parallel execution with dependencies requires careful cycle detection
- **Cross-platform requirements**: Must work on Linux, Windows, macOS with static binaries

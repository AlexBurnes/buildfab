# Active Context: buildfab

## Current Work Focus
**AUTOMATED VERSION MANAGEMENT COMPLETED!** Successfully implemented comprehensive version management system with automatic packaging file updates. **Created version-bump-with-file script** - automated script that bumps version, updates VERSION file, and updates all packaging files (Windows Scoop, macOS Homebrew) in one command. **Updated versioning rules** - enhanced rules to use automated version bump script as recommended method. **Updated complete changes shortcut** - now uses automated version bump script for consistent packaging file updates. **Comprehensive testing** - verified script correctly updates VERSION file, Windows Scoop configuration, and macOS Homebrew formula with proper version numbers and URLs. **Perfect workflow integration** - version bumping now automatically maintains consistency across all packaging files. **VERSION 0.8.0 RELEASED!** Successfully completed automated version management implementation with comprehensive packaging file updates.

**INSTALLER SCRIPTS FIXED!** Successfully fixed all installer scripts and packaging configurations to use correct binary name and repository. **Fixed Linux installer script** - updated `packaging/linux/install.sh` to look for `buildfab` binary instead of `version`. **Fixed installer template** - updated `packaging/linux/installer-template.sh` to download from `burnes/buildfab` repository instead of `AlexBurnes/version-go`. **Updated Windows Scoop configuration** - fixed `packaging/windows/scoop-bucket/version.json` to use current version v0.7.8 and correct URLs. **Updated macOS Homebrew formula** - fixed `packaging/macos/version.rb` to use correct repository, binary name, and version. **All packaging now consistent** - installer scripts correctly download and install the `buildfab` binary from the correct repository with proper versioning.

**BUILDFAB MIGRATION COMPLETED!** Successfully migrated all build functionality from bash scripts to buildfab actions. **Complete build script replacement** - removed `build-conan.sh`, `build-and-package.sh`, and `build-goreleaser.sh` and replaced with native buildfab actions. **CI/CD safety verified** - confirmed GitHub Actions workflows don't use the removed scripts, ensuring no release pipeline breakage. **Enhanced build process** - now uses buildfab's DAG execution with proper dependencies, error handling, and parallel processing. **Improved maintainability** - all build logic now in YAML configuration instead of complex bash scripts. **Updated documentation** - README now includes instructions for installing buildfab from GitHub releases for development.

**VERSION 0.7.2 RELEASED!** Successfully completed comprehensive API simplification and error message improvements. Implemented beautiful v0.5.0 style formatting with proper headers, stage headers, step execution display, and summary statistics. Fixed all major UI issues including correct summary counts, duplicate step display, skipped step visibility, and CLI flag parsing. **Complete v0.5.0 output compatibility** - header with project info, stage headers, step execution with proper icons and indentation, footer summary with statistics. **Fixed summary counting** - now correctly shows successful step counts instead of 0. **Fixed duplicate steps** - eliminated duplicate version-module step display issue. **Fixed skipped steps** - run-tests now properly shows as skipped when version-module fails. **Fixed CLI flag parsing** - -v pre-push now works correctly with proper argument handling. **Library API integration** - all functionality uses modern buildfab library while maintaining beautiful output formatting.

**TEST FIXES COMPLETED!** Successfully fixed all test failures and build issues. **Fixed examples package build failure** - resolved duplicate main function declarations by commenting out one main function and adding proper main function that calls the example functions. **Fixed built-in action support** - updated RunAction method in both Runner and SimpleRunner to properly check action registry for built-in actions like version@check before falling back to custom actions. **Fixed test mode behavior** - modified CLI functions to return errors instead of calling os.Exit(1) when running in test mode using testing.Testing() check. **All tests now passing** - go test ./... -v -race completes successfully with 100% test pass rate across all packages.

**README ENHANCEMENT COMPLETED!** Successfully added comprehensive installation and git hook setup instructions to README.md. **Added detailed installation instructions** - Linux, Windows, and macOS using install scripts and Scoop package manager. **Added git hook setup guide** - step-by-step instructions for automated project validation with buildfab. **Added version utility installation** - instructions for installing version utility from version-go project into ./scripts/ directory for development and testing. **Added project configuration examples** - showing how to set up .project.yml for git hooks with built-in actions. **Added reference to version-go project** - complete documentation link for version utility usage. **Reorganized installation sections** - eliminated duplication and improved user experience with clear navigation.

**MAJOR API SIMPLIFICATION COMPLETED!** Successfully simplified the buildfab library API to address user feedback about callback complexity. Created `SimpleRunner` with basic `RunStage()`, `RunAction()`, and `RunStageStep()` methods that handle all output internally. **Eliminated callback complexity** - consumers no longer need to implement `StepCallback` interface or manage `StepStatus` types. **Kept advanced API** - existing callback-based API remains available for advanced use cases but is now internal. **Updated CLI** - CLI now uses simplified API instead of complex callback system. **Added convenience functions** - `RunStageSimple()` and `RunActionSimple()` for minimal configuration usage. **Comprehensive testing** - added test coverage for simplified API to ensure reliability. **Perfect for consumers** - now consumers can simply call `runner.RunStage(ctx, "stage-name")` with verbose option and all output is handled automatically.

**ENHANCED ERROR MESSAGES COMPLETED!** Successfully implemented v0.5.0 style error messages with proper reproduction instructions and dependency failure details. **Improved error formatting** - instead of generic "command failed: exit status 1", now shows "failed, to check run: [actual command]". **Enhanced skipped messages** - dependency failures now show which specific dependency failed (e.g., "skipped (dependency failed: step-name)"). **Better reproduction instructions** - actual commands are extracted from action configuration and displayed with proper indentation. **Maintained beautiful formatting** - all error messages use v0.5.0 style with proper icons, colors, and alignment. **Comprehensive testing** - added test coverage for enhanced error message functionality. **Perfect user experience** - users get clear, actionable error messages that help them understand and reproduce issues.

**COMMAND ALIGNMENT AND DUPLICATE OUTPUT FIXES COMPLETED!** Successfully fixed command alignment and eliminated duplicate output issues. **Fixed command indentation** - multi-line commands now properly preserve relative indentation structure with 6-space base indentation. **Fixed duplicate output** - eliminated duplicate "FAILED - stage" messages by removing redundant `printSimpleResult` calls from CLI. **Perfect alignment** - commands maintain their original YAML indentation structure while being properly aligned with "to check run:" prefix. **Clean output** - single result message per stage execution with proper summary statistics.

- **Expression evaluation engine**: New `pkg/buildfab/expression.go` with full expression parsing and evaluation system supporting variables, operators, and helper functions
- **Variable system**: Support for `os`, `arch`, `env.VAR`, `inputs.NAME`, `matrix.os`, `ci`, `branch` with proper variable resolution and user variable override
- **Logical operators**: Complete support for `&&`, `||`, `!` with proper operator precedence and parentheses handling
- **Comparison operators**: Support for `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` with lexicographic string comparison and numeric comparison
- **Helper functions**: `contains()`, `startsWith()`, `endsWith()`, `matches()`, `fileExists()`, `semverCompare()` with comprehensive error handling
- **Enhanced condition evaluation**: Updated `evaluateCondition()` function to use new expression system while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Comprehensive test suite**: Created extensive test coverage with 25+ expression tests, 15+ helper function tests, and 20+ condition evaluation tests

### Fixed
- **Variable resolution**: User variables now properly override platform variables in expression context

- **Operator precedence**: Fixed logical operator parsing to handle parentheses and nested expressions correctly
- **Type handling**: Enhanced type conversion functions to handle `int` and `int64` types in numeric comparisons

### Changed

- **Test coverage**: Updated existing variants tests to work with new expression system

## [0.12.0] - 2025-09-23

### Added
- **Action Variants Feature**: Implemented comprehensive action variants feature allowing conditional execution of different commands within a single action based on `when` conditions
- **ActionVariant struct**: New type supporting `when` conditions with `run`, `uses`, and `shell` fields for conditional execution
- **Enhanced Action struct**: Added `Variants` field to support multiple variants per action with first-matching selection logic
- **Conditional evaluation system**: Created `evaluateCondition()` function supporting both `==` and `=` operators with variable interpolation using `${{ variable }}` syntax
- **Variant selection logic**: `SelectVariant()` method picks first matching variant or returns nil for skipping when no conditions match
- **Comprehensive test suite**: Created extensive test coverage for variant selection, condition evaluation, validation, and end-to-end execution scenarios
- **Example YAML configurations**: Added `test-variants.yml`, `test-variants-simple.yml`, and `test-variants-clean.yml` demonstrating variants usage

### Changed
- **Updated execution flow**: Modified both `runActionInternal()` and `executeActionForDAGWithCallback()` to handle variant selection and skipped actions with proper status reporting
- **Enhanced validation**: Updated `Config.Validate()` to ensure actions with variants don't have direct `run`/`uses` fields and each variant has required fields
- **Improved condition syntax**: Support both `==` and `=` operators for equality comparisons in `when` conditions for better user experience

### Technical Details
- **Action variants**: Actions can now define multiple variants with `when` conditions that are evaluated in order
- **Condition evaluation**: Supports simple equality comparisons with variable interpolation (`${{ os == 'linux' }}`, `${{ platform = 'windows' }}`)
- **Automatic skipping**: Actions with variants that don't match any condition are automatically skipped with clear reason
- **Variable integration**: Variants work seamlessly with existing platform variables (`os`, `platform`, `arch`, `os_version`, `cpu`) and custom variables
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing actions without variants continue to work exactly as before

  - Enhanced step completion display - successful actions now show execution time (e.g., "executed successfully - in '0.021s'") while errors and warnings don't show timing
  - Added stage timing - stages now show start message ("▶️ Running stage: stage-name") and completion with timing ("🎉 SUCCESS - stage-name in 3s")

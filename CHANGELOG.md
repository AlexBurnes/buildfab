## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.7] - 2025-09-23

### Fixed

  - When no subcommand is provided, first argument is now treated as stage or action name
  - Stage names have higher priority than action names when both exist with same name
  - Supports both custom actions and built-in actions (version@check, git@untracked, etc.)

  - Maintains backward compatibility with explicit `run` and `action` commands

### Changed
- **Rules Enhancement**: Updated versioning and complete changes rules with changelog date requirements
  - Enhanced `rule-versioning.mdc` with changelog date requirements and commands
  - Updated `rule-complete-changes.mdc` to include proper date management

  - Executor now properly handles context cancellation and terminates promptly without hanging
  - Added comprehensive context cancellation checks throughout DAG execution loops
  - Implemented safe channel operations to prevent panics when context is cancelled
  - Added proper command process termination when context is cancelled

  - Both stdout and stderr are properly streamed and displayed in real-time
  - Works correctly in both verbose and non-verbose modes
  - Users now see actual command execution results as they happen

### Changed
- **Command Content Suppression**: Suppressed command content from YAML configuration to keep output clean
  - Command content from configuration files is no longer displayed during normal execution
  - Added `PrintStepName()` method to show only step names instead of full command content
  - Command content is still preserved in error messages for debugging and manual reproduction
  - Provides cleaner output while maintaining debugging capabilities when errors occur
- **UI Integration**: Enhanced CLI to use internal executor with proper UI interface
  - CLI now uses internal executor instead of simple runner for better UI integration
  - All output formatting is now handled through the UI interface for consistency
  - Proper integration between executor and UI ensures consistent output formatting

### Added
- **TERMINATED Status Display**: Added proper status display when execution is interrupted
  - Shows "‚ö†Ô∏è TERMINATED" status instead of misleading "SUCCESS" when Ctrl+C is pressed

## [0.8.5] - 2025-09-23

### Changed
